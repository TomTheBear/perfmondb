		<td>Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbo&#39;s 0 counter, this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0.   The filtering available is found in the control register - threshold, invert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effectively monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entry.</td>

When QPI is not in a power saving state, it continuously transmits flits across the link.  When there are no protocol flits to send, it will send IDLE and NULL flits  across.

VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN1 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN1 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN1 credit was used.  Note that a single VN1 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN1 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.; Filter for Non-Coherent Standard (NCS).  NCS is commonly used for ?</td>

	 <h3>Introduction</h3>
	  <p>This document provides a reference for performance monitoring events supported 
	  by Intel Performance Monitoring Units (PMUs). The PMU is hardware built inside 
	  a processor to measure its performance parameters such as instruction cycles, 
	  cache hits, cache misses, branch misses and many others. Performance monitoring 
	  events provide facilities to characterize the interaction between programmed 
	  sequences of instructions and microarchitectural sub-systems. </p>
	<p>Performance monitoring events are actively used by such performance profiling 
	  tools as <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/amplifier_help_linux" target="_blank">Intel&reg; 
	  VTune&#8482; Amplifier</a> that provides event-based sampling microarchitecture 
	  analysis types to help you understand how effectively your code uses hardware 
	  resources and recommends relevant optimization techniques.</p>
	<p>For detailed informations on performance monitoring events, see Chapter 18 
	  and Chapter 19 of the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/7c/f1/253669-sdm-vol-3b.pdf" target="_blank">Intel&reg;

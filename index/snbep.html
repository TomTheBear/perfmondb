		<td>Since occupancy counts can only be captured in the Cbo&#39;s 0 counter, this event allows a user to capture occupancy related information by filtering the Cb0 occupancy count captured in Counter 0.   The filtering available is found in the control register - threshold, invert and edge detect.   E.g. setting threshold to 1 can effectively monitor how many cycles the monitored queue has an entry.</td>

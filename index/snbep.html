This event is a component in many key event ratios. The core frequency may change from time to time due to transitions associated with Enhanced Intel SpeedStep Technology or TM2. For this reason this event may have a changing ratio with regards to time. When the core frequency is constant, this event can approximate elapsed time while the core was not in the halt state. It is counted on a dedicated fixed counter, leaving the four (eight when Hyperthreading is disabled) programmable counters available for other events. </td>

The WPQ is used to schedule write out to the memory controller and to track the writes.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the HA to the iMC.

This event is not affected by core frequency changes (for example, P states, TM2 transitions) but has the same incrementing frequency as the time stamp counter. This event can approximate elapsed time while the core was not in a halt state. This event has a constant ratio with the CPU_CLK_UNHALTED.REF_XCLK event. It is counted on a dedicated fixed counter, leaving the four (eight when Hyperthreading is disabled) programmable counters available for other events. Note: On all current platforms this event stops counting during &#39;throttling (TM)&#39; states duty off periods the processor is &#39;halted&#39;.  The counter update is done at a lower clock rate then the core clock the overflow status bit for this counter may appear &#39;sticky&#39;.  After the counter has overflowed and software clears the overflow status bit and resets the counter to less than MAX. The reset value to the counter is not clocked immediately so the overflow status bit will flip &#39;high (1)&#39; and generate another PMI (if enabled) after which the reset value gets clocked into the counter. Therefore, software will get the interrupt, read the overflow status bit &#39;1 for bit 34 while the counter value is less than MAX. Software should ignore this case.</td>

For this reason this event may have a changing ratio with regards to time. When the core frequency is constant, this event can approximate elapsed time while the core was not in the halt state.

These cycles do not include uops routed through because of the switch itself, for example, when Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ) pre-allocation is unavailable, or Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ) is full. SBD-to-MITE switch true penalty cycles happen after the merge mux (MM) receives Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) Sync-indication until receiving the first MITE uop. MM is placed before Instruction Decode Queue (IDQ) to merge uops being fed from the MITE and Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) paths. Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) inserts the Sync-indication whenever a Decode Stream Buffer (DSB)-to-MITE switch occurs.Penalty: A Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) hit followed by a Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) miss can cost up to six cycles in which no uops are delivered to the IDQ. Most often, such switches from the Decode Stream Buffer (DSB) to the legacy pipeline cost 0–2 cycles.</td>

		<td>Number of cycles spent in CKE ON mode.  The filter allows you to select a rank to monitor.  If multiple ranks are in CKE ON mode at one time, the counter will ONLY increment by one rather than doing accumulation.  Multiple counters will need to be used to track multiple ranks simultaneously.  There is no distinction between the different CKE modes (APD, PPDS, PPDF).  This can be determined based on the system programming.  These events should commonly be used with Invert to get the number of cycles in power saving mode.  Edge Detect is also useful here.  Make sure that you do NOT use Invert with Edge Detect (this just confuses the system and is not necessary). (Experimental) </td>

		<td>Counts the number of entries in the Write Pending Queue (WPQ) at each cycle.  This can then be used to calculate both the average queue occupancy (in conjunction with the number of cycles not empty) and the average latency (in conjunction with the number of allocations).  The WPQ is used to schedule writes out to the memory controller and to track the requests.  Requests allocate into the WPQ soon after they enter the memory controller, and need credits for an entry in this buffer before being sent from the CHA to the iMC (memory controller).  They deallocate after being issued to DRAM.  Write requests themselves are able to complete (from the perspective of the rest of the system) as soon they have &#39;posted&#39; to the iMC.  This is not to be confused with actually performing the write to DRAM.  Therefore, the average latency for this queue is actually not useful for deconstruction intermediate write latencies.  So, we provide filtering based on if the request has posted or not.  By using the &#39;not posted&#39; filter, we can track how long writes spent in the iMC before completions were sent to the HA.  The &#39;posted&#39; filter, on the other hand, provides information about how much queueing is actually happenning in the iMC for writes before they are actually issued to memory.  High average occupancies will generally coincide with high write major mode counts. Is there a filter of sorts???</td>

In order to maintain coherency, requests to the same address are not allowed to pass each other up in the Cbo.  Therefore, if there is an outstanding request to a given address, one cannot issue another request to that address until it is complete.  This comes up most commonly with prefetches.  Outstanding prefetches occasionally will not complete their memory fetch and a demand request to the same address will then sit in the IRQ and get retried until the prefetch fills the data into the LLC.  Therefore, it will not be uncommon to see this case in high bandwidth streaming workloads when the LLC Prefetcher in the core is enabled.</td>

		<td>Counts the number of flits transmitted across the QPI Link.  It includes filters for Idle, protocol, and Data Flits.  Each &quot;flit&quot; is made up of 80 bits of information (in addition to some ECC data).  In full-width (L0) mode, flits are made up of four &quot;fits&quot;, each of which contains 20 bits of data (along with some additional ECC data).   In half-width (L0p) mode, the fits are only 10 bits, and therefore it takes twice as many fits to transmit a flit.  When one talks about QPI &quot;speed&quot; (for example, 8.0 GT/s), the &quot;transfers&quot; here refer to &quot;fits&quot;.  Therefore, in L0, the system will transfer 1 &quot;flit&quot; at the rate of 1/4th the QPI speed.  One can calculate the bandwidth of the link by taking: flits*80b/time.  Note that this is not the same as &quot;data&quot; bandwidth.  For example, when we are transfering a 64B cacheline across QPI, we will break it into 9 flits -- 1 with header information and 8 with 64 bits of actual &quot;data&quot; and an additional 16 bits of other information.  To calculate &quot;data&quot; bandwidth, one should therefore do: data flits * 8B / time (for L0) or 4B instead of 8B for L0p.; Number of non-NULL non-data flits transmitted across QPI.  This basically tracks the protocol overhead on the QPI link.  One can get a good picture of the QPI-link characteristics by evaluating the protocol flits, data flits, and idle/null flits.  This includes the header flits for data packets.</td>

		<td>Number of times a VN1 credit was used on the DRS message channel.  In order for a request to be transferred across QPI, it must be guaranteed to have a flit buffer on the remote socket to sink into.  There are two credit pools, VNA and VN1.  VNA is a shared pool used to achieve high performance.  The VN1 pool has reserved entries for each message class and is used to prevent deadlock.  Requests first attempt to acquire a VNA credit, and then fall back to VN1 if they fail.  This counts the number of times a VN1 credit was used.  Note that a single VN1 credit holds access to potentially multiple flit buffers.  For example, a transfer that uses VNA could use 9 flit buffers and in that case uses 9 credits.  A transfer on VN1 will only count a single credit even though it may use multiple buffers.; Filter for Snoop (SNP) message class.  SNP is used for outgoing snoops.  Note that snoop responses flow on the HOM message class.</td>

		<td>Machine clears happen when something happens in the machine that causes the hardware to need to take special care to get the right answer. When such a condition is signaled on an instruction, the front end of the machine is notified that it must restart, so no more instructions will be decoded from the current path.  All instructions &quot;older&quot; than this one will be allowed to finish.  This instruction and all &quot;younger&quot; instructions must be cleared, since they must not be allowed to complete.  Essentially, the hardware waits until the problematic instruction is the oldest instruction in the machine.  This means all older instructions are retired, and all pending stores (from older instructions) are completed.  Then the new path of instructions from the front end are allowed to start into the machine.  There are many conditions that might cause a machine clear (including the receipt of an interrupt, or a trap or a fault).  All those conditions (including but not limited to MACHINE_CLEARS.MEMORY_ORDERING, MACHINE_CLEARS.SMC, and MACHINE_CLEARS.FP_ASSIST) are captured in the ANY event. In addition, some conditions can be specifically counted (i.e. SMC, MEMORY_ORDERING, FP_ASSIST).  However, the sum of SMC, MEMORY_ORDERING, and FP_ASSIST machine clears will not necessarily equal the number of ANY.</td>

		<td>The NO_ALLOC_CYCLES.NOT_DELIVERED event is used to measure front-end inefficiencies, i.e. when front-end of the machine is not delivering micro-ops to the back-end and the back-end is not stalled. This event can be used to identify if the machine is truly front-end bound.  When this event occurs, it is an indication that the front-end of the machine is operating at less than its theoretical peak performance.  Background: We can think of the processor pipeline as being divided into 2 broader parts: Front-end and Back-end. Front-end is responsible for fetching the instruction, decoding into micro-ops (uops) in machine understandable format and putting them into a micro-op queue to be consumed by back end. The back-end then takes these micro-ops, allocates the required resources.  When all resources are ready, micro-ops are executed. If the back-end is not ready to accept micro-ops from the front-end, then we do not want to count these as front-end bottlenecks.  However, whenever we have bottlenecks in the back-end, we will have allocation unit stalls and eventually forcing the front-end to wait until the back-end is ready to receive more UOPS. This event counts the cycles only when back-end is requesting more uops and front-end is not able to provide them. Some examples of conditions that cause front-end efficiencies are: Icache misses, ITLB misses, and decoder restrictions that limit the the front-end bandwidth.</td>

This event might count cycles while a divide is in progress even if the RS is empty.  The divide instruction is one of the longest latency instructions in the machine.

The event continues counting while instructions retire, including during interrupt service routines caused by hardware interrupts, faults or traps.  Background: Modern microprocessors employ extensive pipelining and speculative techniques.  Since sometimes an instruction is started but never completed, the notion of &quot;retirement&quot; is introduced.  A retired instruction is one that commits its states. Or stated differently, an instruction might be abandoned at some point. No instruction is truly finished until it retires.  This counter measures the number of completed instructions.

The event will count MSROM startups for UOPS that are speculative, and subsequently cleared by branch mispredict or machine clear.  Background: UOPS are produced by two mechanisms.  Either they are generated by hardware that decodes instructions into UOPS, or they are delivered by a ROM (called the MSROM) that holds UOPS associated with a specific instruction.  MSROM UOPS might also be delivered in response to some condition such as a fault or other exceptional condition.
